                                            Hello, My name is Roger Graham Jacobsen, a maker, a designer, and a graduate with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Western Washington University. During this period I gained a strong understanding of computational software and hardware through my classes, work experience, and personal projects/hobbies.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3 class="fw-bold">Education</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            My educational journey began with an Associates in Science, taking advantage of early college credit opportunities to leverage a swift degree completion and transition into a Computer Science major and a Mathematics minor at my university. Mostly taught in C and Java, this period had me learning a vast array of software development skills from operating systems development to image processing. With my new skills in hand, I took charge and continued development on my own front. I began by focusing on Front-End Development work, hardening my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while developing new skills in libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, React.js, as well as many others while simultaneously working on development of a turn based strategy game in Unity 3D and C#.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3 class="fw-bold">Work Experience</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            During my time at university, I sought opportunities to apply my growing knowledge. This led me to a part-time role as an electronics repair technician at CPR Cellphone Repair in Bellingham, WA. It was here at CPR that I got first hand experience with hardware diagnosis and design as I worked diligently on a large variety of devices from phones and computers to game consoles and watches. Collectively, working here I learned many things including soldering, board diagnosis, device repair, customer service, inventory management, and eventually store management and interviewing.

                                            Beyond my degree, my hobbies include practicing music, mostly piano and guitar, laser cutting, brewing, and engaging in various other types of creative activities that don't consistently follow a single theme. In alignment with this, I have been spending my free time volunteering at my local Makerspace where I am surrounded by like minded individuals and can work on projects with a community I respect. My volunteer time is spent doing a variety of tasks such as teaching classes, assisting with projects, and overall being a good face to the space.

                                            Coming to today I took some time off of my career to assist in the remodeling of a family home while building a few projects in the remaining time including this personal portfolio website. With the remodel now complete I began focusing on expanding my skills beyond Front-End Development and onto Full-Stack Dev as well as learning, and constructing small projects utilizing various pseudo-random generation algorithms in preparation for addition to my Unity project while spending my remaining time volunteering and working on projects at the Makerspace.

I have become really fascinated in procedural generation algorithms and Sudoku was an amazing project to help in the learning about Wave Function Collapse and the entropy of a system. In this context, each cell has a base entropy that decreases over time as more neighboring cells have reduced entropy.</p>
                                                <p>A follow up project would involve an image generator that can create "random" images from a set of smaller connecting images where each smaller image has rules for its neighboring connections.</p>
