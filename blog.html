                <p>
                    As the title suggests I have no idea of what type of content to place here. One day I might change
                    it to
                    more suit a form of application style similar to that of Professor Banson's. Now thats one sexy
                    site. However at this point in time I do not think I pertain the skills involved to achieve such
                    excellence. So for now I am riding off a couple of nice free mountain images I found on <a
                    href="http://www.picjumbo.com">Picjumbo</a> along with some of my own gifs and videos mostly done as test footage and/or to get reddit clout.

                <p>
                    This class was very fun. Not sure if its because its a break for me from my other classes or if its
                    enjoyable in itself. I do like being able to see and watch my product unfold as its being created.
                    The live extention is amazing for that. There is a lot of cool little tricks and manipulations you
                    can do with css that has been occupying my extra time on this project. Did you notice how on the
                    home page the water reflection was made by flipping the top image and giving it an alpha level of 0.5.
                    The original image actually has no water in it. Cool huh.

                    Mountains are cool right. Its one of the earths great gifts to humanity. <br> <br>
                    The fact that we can percieve beauty is astounding. Somewhere along humanities growth we evolved the
                    capability to experience beauty. Why?
                    Is it evolutionarily beneficial to our survival or was it just something that we gained that didn't
                    hurt us in the log run. <br> <br>
                    Maby it had something to do with finding a mate but if so why then do we view things such as
                    mountains to be so astonishing to us. All it is is a collection of matter. Theoretically this
                    hunk of rock should be no more beautiful to you than your floor at home. Yet people seek out these
                    locations.
